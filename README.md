## Warning
This is an over-engineered toy project. The APIs being used to get weather and cities' photographs may retrieve inaccurate (and funny!) results.

## Development Scripts
> This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.<br />
The page will reload if you make edits, and you'll also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

#### `yarn standard`

Lints and automatically fixes code according to [JavaScript Standard Style](https://github.com/feross/standard) rules.

#### `yarn flow`

Checks for [Flow](https://flow.org) type errors.
